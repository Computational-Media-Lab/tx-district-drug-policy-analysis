    Given a sentence from a school district policy document, categorize it into either none, one, or more of the given categories using the key words that go with each category.
    These are the categories and their corresponding key words:
    {category_terms}

    For example, if given the sentence "Student will be suspended if drug use is detected", then categorize it as the following categories:
    total number of drug or alcohol terms mentioned,number of times suspension or synonyms are mentioned

    The output format should be categories separated by commas with no spaces in between.
    Terms with different tenses (past, present, future) or singular vs plural count as the same term. For example, "suspended" and "suspension" should be counted as the same term. Similarly, "drug" and "drugs" should be counted as the same term.
    Ignore any headings, subheadings or other non-sentence text. Only categorize actual sentences that are part of the policy text.

    Categorize this school drug policy line:
    "{line}"

    Return the relevant categories, or "None" if irrelevant.
